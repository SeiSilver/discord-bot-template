# DÃ­cord bot template

## Requirements

- Node.js
- Discord.js

## Note

The `DiscordFactory` will autoload all of your Discord commands and events.

If you want to add more events or commands, you just need to put them all in the `events` and `commands` folders.

You will need to assign your handler/command/event path. The handler will run `commandHandler.ts` and `eventHandler.ts` to autoload all of your commands and events into the Discord client.

You can keep this as the default. However, if you need to refactor the code, you will need to update the location. For example:

```typescript
import { DiscordFactory } from "@service/discord/discordFactory";

const HANDLER_PATH = 'services/discord/handlers';
const COMMAND_PATH = "services/discord/commands";
const EVENT_PATH = "services/discord/events";

const discordFactory = new DiscordFactory(HANDLER_PATH, COMMAND_PATH, EVENT_PATH);

discordFactory.init();
```
